In 2D computer games the objects that you see on screen are typically composed
of simpler objects like circles or polygons. Code written in a game engine module
enables these objects to morph or interact with other objects during game-play. In
this project you will be building a minimal 2D game engine that can be used to
create and modify convex polygon objects.
