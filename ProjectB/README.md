This project focuses on string manipulation to model disordered materials in materials science. Students will work with crystal structure files, implementing Python functions to parse, modify, and generate representations of ordered and disordered materials. Key tasks include extracting structural details, replacing atomic elements, and managing substitutional disorder in crystals. The project emphasizes algorithmic problem-solving while exploring the computational modeling of materials at an atomic level.
