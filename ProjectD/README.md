This project involved working with real-world CO2 flux data using Python.
Key tasks included data cleaning, handling missing values, and performing exploratory
data analysis using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
Built regression models to predict CO2 flux based on environmental variables
and used visualizations to analyze seasonal and long-term trends in the data.
The project emphasized practical applications of machine learning to environmental
science challenges.
